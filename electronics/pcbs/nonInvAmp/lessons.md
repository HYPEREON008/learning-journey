1\. Infinite Open-Loop Gain 

A→∞ 

● The op-amp amplifies the difference between V+ and V- infinitely. 

● In practice, this means any finite output requires V+≈V- when negative feedback is 

applied. 

2\. Infinite Input Impedance 

I+ = I− = 0 

● No current flows into the inverting (−) or non-inverting (+) input. 

● The op-amp does not load the source circuit. 

3\. Zero Output Impedance 

Rout=0 

● The output can drive any load without voltage drop. 

● Ideal op-amp output behaves like a perfect voltage source. 

4\. Infinite Bandwidth 

● The op-amp can amplify signals of any frequency without attenuation. 

5\. Infinite Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) 

● The op-amp ignores any voltage common to both inputs: 

Vout = A⋅((V+)-(V-)) 

● If V+ = V- , output = 0, regardless of common voltage magnitude. 

6\. Infinite Slew Rate 

● Output can change instantaneously to follow the input difference.
