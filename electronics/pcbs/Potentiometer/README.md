Potentiometer Circuit Schematic + PCB



Example applications of potentiometers: 

● Volume control in audio equipment (log taper pots often used...our ears also working that 

way). 

● Brightness control for displays and LEDs (simple analog control). 

● Position sensor (potentiometer used as a basic angle/position sensor/transducer). 

● User input knob for variable speed motor controllers, adjustable timers, etc.
